        <h1>Alabama Astrobotics</h1>
        <p>
            Alabama Astrobotics is a student design teams whos main goal is to complete in NASA's mining challenge each year.
            This requires the team to build a fully autonomous lunar minning rover over the course of the year. The team itself
            is split into four subteams: systems, mechanical, electrical, and software. I am currently a junior member on the software
            subteam. This role as allowed me to complete a number of projects that have improved path planning, localization of the robot,
            and quarenteed that the repository is accessable in the event of git failure. Details of these projects can be found
            <a class="inline" href="astro/astro_projects.html">here</a>.

        <h1>Association for Computing Machinery - Womens</h1>
        <p>
            The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) is a national student organization that promots communtiy and networking
            within the field of computer science. The womens division (ACM-W) has the same goal with the additional goal of promoting
            diversity and inclusion within the field, espessially for women. The UA chapter of this organization was rebooted at the end
            of last year, and has only recently regained its status as a student organization allowing it to recieve funding. Since the 
            club is so new, all members have been incouraged to take a more active role in the organization. This includes promoting the
            club to peers who may be interested, pitching ideas for workshops, and leading presentations during meetings.
