                I am currently a junior at the University of Alabama majoring in computer science at the <a class="inline" href="../school/school.html">University of Alabama</a>.
                I graduated from <a class="inline" href="../school/school.html">Oxford High School</a> in Oxford, AL in May of 2022 as the Validictorian. I began attending UA in
                the fall of 2022. Since then, I have joined and maintained active membership in <a class="inline" href="../orgs/orgs.html">Alabama Astrobotics</a> and the UA

            <p>
                Through out my freshman year I worked in a <a class="inline" href="../work/experience.html">reseach lab</a> in the depatment of Electrical and Computer Engineering working on
                using radar data to replace LiDAR in autonomous driving algrthims and developing a sytem to detect human vital signs using
                radar. In the upcoming summer, I will be interning at <a class="inline" href="../work/experience.html">Southern Company</a> as a cyber security intern with hopes to develop my
                skills in data analytics and cyber security technologies.
